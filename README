Stats is a simple script to print basic system statistics and immortalize those
results with a screenshot on GNU/Linux systems. The most popular Linux
distributions are officially supported by this script, although any reasonable,
modern GNU/Linux system should have no problem running it. It with typical
end-user desktop installations in mind, but a limited subset of the
functionality afforded to those systems is provided on headless machines. This
script will automatically detect the functionality available and print the
associated system information accordingly, or fail gracefully if it cannot.
