Supported Operating Systems
===========================

    Although this script could be modified to support a wide variety of
reasonably POSIX-compliant operating systems, the support load in that scenario
would be enormous. Therefore Stats only supports GNU/Linux systems. Even so,
there is some disparity between the setups employed by various Linux
distributions. To limit the scope of this variation somewhat this script
officially targets systems with the Linux Standard Base, which encompasses
virtually every modern Linux distribution. Therefore the hard requirements of
this script are a GNU/Linux operating system configured with the Linux Standard
Base and Perl 5.10 or later.

    The hard requirements listed above represent the bare minimum required to
run this script, but there are a few Linux distributions which have explicit
support in Stats. They are listed below along with the oldest supported
release.
    * Red Hat Enterprise Linux  >= 6.0
    * CentOS                    >= 6.0
    * Fedora                    >= 15
    * Debian                    >= 6.0
    * Ubuntu                    >= 12.04.0
    * Linux Mint                >= 13
    * Arch Linux
    * openSUSE                  >= 12.3

Dependencies
============

    Perl 5.10 is the most critical dependency of this script. Since that is
quite an old version it is not much of a problem today. Many important utility
scripts are written in Perl so it is installed by default by virtually every
Linux distribution, including some targeted at embedded devices. Realistically
the version is the only major stipulation, which is the reason RHEL 5.x and
Debian 5.x are not supported.

    The basic Perl installation is enough to satisfy the language dependency
on most distributions, but additional Perl modules are required on some
distributions. The aforementioned distributions are listed below along with the
commands necessary to install the additional language dependencies.
    * Fedora            yum install perl-Switch
    * Arch Linux        pacman -S perl-switch
    * openSUSE          zypper install perl-Switch

    As mentioned in the "Supported Operating Systems" section above, the
Linux Standard Base is also a requirement. The script will technically "run"
without this, but it will politely die before accomplishing anything remotely
useful. Fortunately this is installed by default on virtually every modern
Linux distribution and therefore not much of an issue. I mention this
dependency explicitly because it is probably a good idea to depend on lsb-base
and lsb-release if you are packaging Stats for your distribution.

Installation
============

   By-and-large Stats does not need to be installed. It does not require
elevated privileges so you can run it from anywhere you like as a normal user.
However if it has not been packaged for your distribution and you would like to
install it for all users, you can do so by issuing the following command as
root (which typically entails prefixing the command with "sudo" or "su -c")
from the top-level directory of the Stats source tree.
    # install -m 755 ./src/stats.pl /usr/local/bin/haggis-stats

    If you choose to manually install Stats for all users you may also wish to
install its man page. You can do so by issuing the following commands as root
after you have installed the script itself.
    # install -m 755 -d /usr/local/man/man1
    # install -m 644 ./man/stats.1 /usr/local/man/man1/haggis-stats.1
    # gzip /usr/local/man/man1/haggis-stats.1
