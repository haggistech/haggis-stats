stats for Debian
----------------

Although upstream referrs to this program simply as "Stats" in most cases, the
official INSTALL document recommends that it be installed using the less
generic name "haggis-stats". This package takes that suggestion, so the program
can be executed using the command "haggis-stats" and its manual can be viewed
using the command "man haggis-stats", just like one would expect.
